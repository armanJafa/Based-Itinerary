WORKING WITH GIT:
Pick a story to work on,
create a branch for the story,
implement the story,
TRACK THE CHANGES YOU MAKE WITH A SIMPLE CHANGELOG,
save a backup of your branch,
pull to get latest changes into your branch,
handle the pull (make sure everything you pulled works, and make sure your implementation works too),
create a pull request to master when you're done. Xavier will merge your branch.

IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING, LABEL THE STORY WITH "question" AND ADD A COMMENT. (on waffle)
Post something in the hangout.

If there's a task you can't finish, label the story "help wanted" and post a comment on waffle
Post something in the hangout as well.

QMessageBoxes look like this:
int ret = QMessageBox::warning(this, tr("My Application"),
                               tr("The document has been modified.\n"
                                  "Do you want to save your changes?"),
                               QMessageBox::Save | QMessageBox::Discard
                               | QMessageBox::Cancel,
                               QMessageBox::Save);
qDebug() << ret;

Be sure to put functions in the correct places.
For example, if you create a new button in admin page, put the slot for that button under the correct comment heading in primewin.cpp and in primewin.h
