WHEN YOU CREATE A FUNCTION:
Make sure the FIRST thing you do is move it to a logical location in the code
For example, if you create a new button in admin page, put the slot for that button under the correct comment heading in primewin.cpp and in primewin.h
(it would be under the comment line, "//Index4=========...")


WORKING WITH GIT:
~ Pick a story to work on
~ Follow the instructions from the link on the README
~ When you think you're done, CREATE A LOCAL BACKUP
~ Go to GitHub, merge master INTO your branch (not the other way around)
~ Pull the new changes
~ Resolve any conflicts
~ Push up to your branch
~ Create a pull request


WHEN YOU COMMIT:
Mention your story somewhere in your commit message. E.g. "#10" for issue 10.


IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING:
LABEL THE STORY WITH "question" AND ADD A COMMENT. (on waffle)
Post something in the hangout.


IF THERE'S A TASK YOU CAN'T FINISH:
Label the story "help wanted" and post a comment on waffle
Post something in the hangout as well.


QMESSAGEBOXES LOOK LIKE THIS:
QMessageBox::warning(this, tr("My Application"),
                     tr("The document has been modified.\n"
                        "Do you want to save your changes?"),
                     QMessageBox::Save | QMessageBox::Discard;
