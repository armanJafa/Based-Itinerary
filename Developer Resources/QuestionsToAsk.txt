Is there always going to be one team per one stadium, or will there be a case where multiple teams share one stadium?

What is park typology? (Referencing requirement 1.9)

Would adding a new stadium require modifying the map given to us, or would we just be adding a new stadium next to an already existing one, similar to the case between Dodger stadium and Angels Stadium?

Will the program have to handle demolishing a stadium? If so, how would that work in terms of the distances?

For number 1 under "Planning a vacation," do you mean choose ONE stadium to visit, so when you're on your way there, you'll also just visit any stadiums that are coincidentally along the way? 
So for example, if I wanted to go to Safeco Field in Washington, would the trip also involve visiting Dodger Stadium, AT&T Park, and O.co Coliseum as well?

So if we use Qt's built in sort function, which runs in O(nlogn), but we don't know what algorithm Qt is using, how would we write that down in our Big O analysis?
