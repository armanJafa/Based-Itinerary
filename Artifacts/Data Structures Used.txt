~VECTOR of stadium objects
	VECTOR of souvenir objects (each stadium object has a vector of souvenirs)
	VECTOR of team objects (each stadium has a vector of teams)
Reason: The program only requires stadium information retrieval, so a vector's constant-time data retrieval is the best option.

~GRAPH of stadiums-distances relationships
Reason: The program will use a graph implemented by means of an adjacency matrix to store all stadiums and the flight distances between. An adjacency matrix will allow constant-time distance queries, so it is the ideal option.

~DOUBLY LINKED LIST of  of itinerary objects
Reason: The program will need to reorder the itinerary very often. Since a doubly linked list allows for constant-time data reordering, it is the ideal option.
