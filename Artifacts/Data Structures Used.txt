vector of stadium objects
	each stadium has a vector of souv objects
		(vectors allow constant-time data retrieval)

optimization will use a graph implemented by means of an adjacency matrix
	(adjacency matrix will allow constant-time distance queries)
	(Djikstra's algorithm will be O(ElogV))

itinerary will use a list of itinerary objects
	(double linked list allows for constant-time reordering of the itinerary)
